# Tuesdays With Morrie

### 1. The Curriculum

- He was the student in his Professor's last class
  - Not a typical class—no grades, philosophical

### 2. The Syllabus

- Morrie loved dancing by himself
  - He would go to a dance club full of students on Wednesdays—no one knew he was a famous Phd in Sociology 
- But then, he got sick
  - Diagnosed with ALS—no known cure
    - "ALS is like a lit candle: it melts your nerves and leaves your body in a pile of wax"
  - His life quickly changed as he couldn't continue doing what he normally would but he kept teaching
- He wanted people to learn from what he was going through
  - He was not afraid of dying
- He had a living funeral because he wanted to hear and feel with the people who would be there
