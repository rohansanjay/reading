### Introduction

- Charisma can be turned on and off—it's not something people are born with
- It's based on non-verbal behaviors
- One you learn, it becomes instinctual 
- When you meet someone charismatic, you think they are powerful and they like you a lot
  - So all you need to do is give off the impression that you possess high power and high warmth
  - Three crucial aspects: 
    - power
    - presence
    - warmth

*Charisma is a science that anyone can learn*

### 2. The Charismatic Behaviors: Presence, Power, and Warmth

- Presence
  - People notice when you aren't listening—it makes them feel inferior and you lose their trust
  - Have moment-to-moment awareness—pay attention to what's going wrong rather than getting caught up in your own thoughts
  - Three things to think about when staying present
    - Sound: your ears are satellite dishes, passively and objectively registering sounds
    - Breath: imagine your breath is someone you want to give full attention to
    - Toes: get into the physical sensation of movement
  - When in conversation, think about whether your mind is wandering and bring yourself back by focusing on your breath or toes for a second
  - Presence makes you more impactful, memorable, and grounded
- Power and Warmth
  - Powerful = being able to affect the world around us
    - Clues of power in appearance, reaction, and **body language**
  - Warmth = goodwill toward others -> will someone use the power they have in your favor
    - Entirely though body language and behavior
  - **people tend to accept what you project**
- Charismatic Body Language
  - Whatever is in your mind shows up in your body
    - **charismatic behaviors must originate in your mind**
  - You need strong internal skills: being aware of what is happening inside you and knowing how to handle it
  - Your mind can't tell fact from fiction
    - Ex: you get scared by a scary movie even though you know it's just a movie
    - So if you are in a charismatic mental state, your body will manifest charismatic body language 
    - Nocebo effect: the mind creates toxic consequences in the body in reaction to completely fictional causes

*Our imagination can dramatically enhance or inhibit our charisma, depending on its content*
