### To Do

- Reduce how quickly and often you nod
- Pause for 2 seconds at the end of sentences
- Focus on your breath and toes to help you stay present
- Body language is powerful—you must display charismatic body language and this starts with a charismatic internal state in the mind (get the internal state right)
- Use the responsibility transfer to reduce anxiety, uncertainty, and dissatisfaction that will otherwise present itself in body language and inhibit charisma
- Remember that everyone experiences mental negativity
- Dedramatize, destigmatize, neutralize

### Introduction

- Charisma can be turned on and off—it's not something people are born with
- It's based on non-verbal behaviors
- One you learn, it becomes instinctual 
- When you meet someone charismatic, you think they are powerful and they like you a lot
  - So all you need to do is give off the impression that you possess high power and high warmth
  - Three crucial aspects: 
    - power
    - presence
    - warmth

*Charisma is a science that anyone can learn*

### 1. Charisma Demystified

- Make others feel like the smartest person in the world, not yourself
- 3 ways to boost charisma during conversation
  - Lower the intonation of your voice at the end of your sentences
  - Reduce how quickly and often you nod
  - Pause for 2 full seconds before you speak

*It takes practice*

### 2. The Charismatic Behaviors: Presence, Power, and Warmth

- Presence
  - People notice when you aren't listening—it makes them feel inferior and you lose their trust
  - Have moment-to-moment awareness—pay attention to what's going wrong rather than getting caught up in your own thoughts
  - Three things to think about when staying present
    - Sound: your ears are satellite dishes, passively and objectively registering sounds
    - Breath: imagine your breath is someone you want to give full attention to
    - Toes: get into the physical sensation of movement
  - When in conversation, think about whether your mind is wandering and bring yourself back by focusing on your breath or toes for a second
  - Presence makes you more impactful, memorable, and grounded
- Power and Warmth
  - Powerful = being able to affect the world around us
    - Clues of power in appearance, reaction, and **body language**
  - Warmth = goodwill toward others -> will someone use the power they have in your favor
    - Entirely though body language and behavior
  - **people tend to accept what you project**
- Charismatic Body Language
  - Whatever is in your mind shows up in your body
    - **charismatic behaviors must originate in your mind**
  - You need strong internal skills: being aware of what is happening inside you and knowing how to handle it
  - Your mind can't tell fact from fiction
    - Ex: you get scared by a scary movie even though you know it's just a movie
    - So if you are in a charismatic mental state, your body will manifest charismatic body language 
    - Nocebo effect: the mind creates toxic consequences in the body in reaction to completely fictional causes

*Our imagination can dramatically enhance or inhibit our charisma, depending on its content*

### 3. The Obstacles to Presence, Power, and Warmth

- Physical discomfort
  - Any physical discomfort that affects your visible, external state even slightly may affect how charismatic you are perceived to be
  - Counteracting physical discomfort
    - prevent: plan ahead
      - Location, clothing comfort, sunlight, weather, hunger, etc.
    - recognize: awareness
      - Do you look tense? 
    - remedy/explain: do something about it
      - Giving voice will allow you to move on from it
- Mental Discomfort
  - You need to be comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity
  - Responsibility transfer (steps on pg. 35)
    - Pick an entity and transfer the weight of everything you are concerned about to this entity—they're in charge now and you are no longer responsible for the outcome
  - Notice when you are making comparisons and use the responsibility transfer to alleviate any discomfort it's causing you
  - Self-criticism is a silent killer—other people don't know about it and will think your reactions are directed at them
  - The reason your mind blanks in stressful situations (e.g. taking a test) is because the body naturally shuts downs superfluous functions during fight-or-flight situations
  - Even the most intelligent and competent people feel self-doubt and experience the imposter syndrome
    - Yes, it can be a great motivator to make you work hard... but at what cost? It impairs your body language, interactions, makes you enjoy life less, etc. 
    - Much better to be motivated by confidence and the joy of achievement 

*Your mental state is crucial in your ability to project charismatic body language—know which internal obstacles are inhibiting your charisma potential*

### 4. Overcoming the Obstacles

- Step 1: destigmatize discomfort
  - Discomfort and negativity is a natural part of life that everyone experiences—understand this
    - Instead, we feel like these feelings shouldn't be happening
    - We feel bad about feeling bad
  - Feeling bad is a byproduct of one of our brain's survival mechanisms
    - Think of others who have gone through what you are going through
  - You are not alone
  - Shame is the real killer because we feel we'd be excluded by those who matter to our survival
    - We feel ashamed for feeling some way
    - It is a standard part of human experience that everyone feels from time to time
  - Put it into practice
    - Remember that uncomfortable emotions are normal and a legacy of our survival instincts that everyone feels from time to time
    - Dedramatize: this is a common part of human experience that happens every day
    - Think of others that have gone through it before
    - See it as a burden shared by many
- Step 2: neutralize negativity
  - Realize that your thoughts aren't necessarily accurate
    - Someone's visible discomfort could be completely internal—it's not necessarily about you
  - We think our mind has an accurate view of reality but it's often distorted
    - Our mind unconsciously filters things
    - Negativity bias: our brain usually focuses on negative things
      - When this happens, remind yourself that you may not be getting an accurate perception of reality
  - Put it into practice
    - Don't assume your thoughts are accurate
    - See your thoughts as little electrical impulses
    - Assign a label to your negative experience (ex: self-criticism, anxiety, etc.)
    - Depersonalize the experience (ex: there is shame being felt)
    - Imagine seeing yourself from afar
    - Imagine the worst-case outcome—you'll survive
- Step 3: rewrite reality
  - Deciding to change your belief about what happened (cognitive reappraisal) effectively decreases the brain's stress levels
    - Much better than attempting to repress or ignore emotions
    - Decide to interpret everything favorably for yourself
    - **write it down**
  - Use cases
    - Charisma: whenever a situation threatens your level of warmth of confidence
    - Minor events: reduce anger or impatience and generate compassion
  - Put it into practice
    - Ask yourself, "what if ... is a good thing?"
    - Write it down in the present tense
- Delving into sensations
  - Get comfortable with discomfort by fulling immersing yourself in it when you feel it
  - Focus on the physical sensations distract your mind and stay present

*Destigmatize, detach, and rewrite*

  - Ask open ended questions (ex: what brought you here tonight, why are you at this event)
    - All POSITIVE

    - Say *YOU* not I
- Graceful exit—leave others with positive feelings
  - Don't wait too long, people get uncomfortable 
    - Have an official reason
  - Offer something of value
    - Information (article, website), connection (you can intro), visibility (invite them to something), recognition (an award you think they should get)
    - This makes them feel good because you are giving them something

*People don't care about/remember what you said but how they felt—the emotional imprint remains*

### 8. Speaking—and Listening—with Charisma

- Charismatic listening: attentive listening, refraining from interrupting, and deliberate pausing
  - You NEED to be present
    - Focus on physical sensations/breath if you are zoning out/impatient
  - NEVER interrupt ever even from excitement because people will resent you for not getting in their last word
    - If someone keeps interrupting you, keep your sentences short and pause frequently
  - Let people spend all the time talking about themselves
  - PAUSE before you answer (two seconds)
    - Let your face react first to show you've absorbed what they just said
    - Sequence
      - They finish their statement
      - Your face absorbs
      - Your face reacts
      - Then you answer
- Charismatic speaking: people associate you with whatever feelings you produce in them
  - Make others feel good about themselves with strong positive associations
  - Handle compliments like a boss
    - Stop
    - Absorb the compliment and enjoy it
    - Let this absorption show on your face so the person knows they've made an impact
    - Thank them. "Thank you very much" -> "You've just made my day"
  - Become truly interested in other people -> fast friends
  - Imagine people you speak with are main stars in movies (make them feel that way)
  - Let people impress you and they will love you for it, make them feel smart and you don't have to worry about sounding smart
- Get graphic: a picture is worth a thousand words (metaphors)
  - Speak in pictures whenever you can
  - Make the images sensory rich (involve as many as five senses)
  - Once imagined, an image is very hard to forget -> be careful and intentional
  - Don't say no problem—instead, "We'll take care of it"
- Deliver high value
  - Make people feel entertained, informed, and goood
  - The longer you speak, the higher the price you make people pay for their time (use few words and lots of pictures)
- Tuning your voice: voice fluctuations is a foundation for vocal warmth and power
  - Pitch (high/low), volume (loud/quiet), tone (resonant/hollow), tempo (fast/slow), rhythm (fluid/staccato)
  - Power = lower, projected, and slow
  - Warmth = smile (even on the phone!)

*Smile, pause, and let other people talk*
