### The Charismatic Behaviors: Presence, Power, and Warmth

  - Three things to think about when staying present
    - Sound: your ears are satellite dishes, passively and objectively registering sounds
    - Breath: imagine your breath is someone you want to give full attention to
    - Toes: get into the physical sensation of movement
  - When in conversation, think about whether your mind is wandering and bring yourself back by focusing on your breath or toes for a second
  - Presence makes you more impactful, memorable, and grounded
