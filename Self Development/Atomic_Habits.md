### Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
- improving by 1% isn't notable (or noticeable), but it is meaningful in the long run
  - 1% better each day = 37% better after one year but 1% worse every day = almost 0 after a year
  - habits can compound for or against you -> double edged sword
- forget about goals and focus on systems
  - goals = results -> good for setting direction
    - winners and losers have the same goals
    - achieving a goal is only a momentary change
  - systems = processes that lead to results -> good for **making progress**
    - spend more time designing systems of continuous small improvements
- atomic = a tiny change and (like atoms as building blocks) and habits are like the atoms of our life
- *try to get 1% better each day*

### Chapter 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity
- there are three layers of behavior change
  1. changing your outcomes -> **what you get**
    - ex: losing weight, winning a competition, etc.
  2. changing your process -> **what you do**
    - new routine at the gym, becoming more organized, etc.
  3. changing your identity (deepest) -> **what you believe**
    - changing your beliefs, worldview, self-image, judgments
- build identity based habits by focusing on *who* you wish to become 
  - NOT what you want to achieve
  - ex: I want to quit smoking vs. I am not a smoker
  - the more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior
- the real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results but because they can change your beliefs about yourself
- *habits are beliefs*

### Chapter 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
- a habit is a behavior repeated enough times to become automatic
- 4 parts to a habit: cue, craving, response, reward
  - cue triggers the craving, which motivates a response, which satisfies the craving, and ultimately becomes associated with the cue
      - form a neurological feedback loop -> habit loop
      - ex: you wake up, you want to feel alert, you drink coffee, you satisfy your craving to feel alert -> drinking coffee becomes associated with waking up
- the 4 laws of behavior change
  - if you want to make a behavior change, ask yourself the following 4 questions:
    1. How can I make it obvious/invisible?
    2. How can I make it attractive/unattractive?
    3. How can I make it easy/difficult?
    4. How can I make it satisfying/unsatisfying?
- *habits are a cycle—use the cycle to your advantage*

### Chapter 4: The Man Who Didn't Look Right
- you don't need to be aware of a cue for a habit to begin
  - your actions become automatic as habits form
  - the first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them
- *make sure you are aware of your habits*

### Chapter 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit
- implementation intention: a plan you make beforehand about **when** and **where** to act
  - how you plan to implement a habit
  - format: when situation X rises, I will perform response Y
  - people who make a specific plan for when & where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through
    - I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]
- the Diderot Effect: obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases
  - ex: you buy a dress and then matching shoes, earrings... a chain reaction of purchases
  - habit stacking: identify a habit you already do every day and then stack your new behavior on top
  - after I \[CURRENT HABIT], I will \[NEW HABIT]
    - ex: after I pour my cup of coffee, I will meditate
    - you can create larger stacks by chaining smaller habits
- *have a plan*

### Chapter 6: Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More
- you don't have to be a victim of your environment, you can be an architect of it
  - make the cue a big part of your environment
  - make the **best** choice the most **obvious** one -> easy when cues for good habits are in front of you
- a stable environment where everything has a place and purpose is an environment where habits can easily form
  - it is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting old cues
- *if you see it, you'll do it -> make yourself see it*

### Chapter 7: The Secret to Self-Control
- people with self-control are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control
  - they are usually the ones that use it least -> it's easier to practice restraint when you don't have to use it often
  - create a more disciplined environment
- once a habit becomes encoded, the urge to act follows whenever a cue reappears -> behavior change techniques can backfire
  - ex: shaming people to lose weight can make them feel stress so they overeat to cope
  - habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself
    - ex: you feel bad so you eat junk food and when you eat junk food, you feel bad -> it's a downward spiral...
- you can break a habit, but you are unlikely to forget it
  - so cut bad habits off at the source
    - reduce exposure to the cues that cause them
    - ex: move the TV out of your bedroom, stop following social media accounts that make you feel jealous, etc. 
    - instead of making it obvious, make it invisible
- *it's easier to avoid temptation than resist it*

### Chapter 8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible
- habit stacking + temptation building
  - formula: 
    1. after I \[CURRENT HABIT], I will \[HABIT I NEED]
    2. after I \[HABIT I NEED], I will \[HABIT I WANT]
- temptation building is a way to create a heightened version of any habit by connecting it with something you already want
- habits are dopamine driven: when dopamine rises, we are more likely to act
  - the anticipation of a reward, not the fulfillment of it, gets us to act
- *make your habits attractive*

### Chapter 9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits
- humans are herd animals -> we want to fit in
  - social norms are the invisible rules that guide human behavior
  - we imitate three groups
    1. the close
      - proximity has a powerful effect on behavior
      - physical & social environment
    2. the many
      - we look to the group to guide our behavior
      - the tribe overpowers the individual
    3. the powerful
      - we want power, prestige, and status
      - greater power = more resources...
- *surround yourself with the people you want to become*

### Chapter 10: How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits
- every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper, underlying motive
  - I want to eat tacos (craving) -> I need food to survive -> I have to eat to survive (motive)
  - habits are modern day solutions to ancient desires
  - life feels reactive but it is actually predictive
- reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast way to reprogram your mind to think habits are more attractive
  - give yourself motivation by doing something you enjoy right before a difficult habit
- *link habits with your feelings*

### Chapter 11: Walk Slowly, but Never Backward
- you don't need to map out everything of a new habit, you just need to practice it
  - make your habit more systematic through repetition -> long-term potentiation
- automaticity: perform a behavior without thinking about each step
  - the learning curve is based on **frequency**, not time -> it's the number of **repetitions**
- the most effective form of learning is practice, not planning
- *to build a habit, you need to practice it—get your reps in*

### Chapter 12: The Law of Least Effort
- energy is precious and the brain wants to conserve it -> it's human nature to follow the law of least effort
  - you naturally choose the option with the least amount of work (most value for least effort)
  - so make it as easy as possible to do things that pay off in the long run
    - environment design
    - reduce friction
    - addition by subtraction: when you remove points of friction, you achieve more with less effort
- *design a world where it is easy to do the right thing*

### Chapter 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rules
- habits might just take a second, but they influence actions that can take minutes or hours -> ramp to the highway
  - every day, there are a few moments that have a huge impact: **decisive moments**
    - ex: cooking or ordering, driving or walking, homework or TV...
    - it's like a decision matrix where whether you make a good or bad choose determines your path throughout the day
- two minute rule: when you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes
  - ex: read one page, take out yoga mat, open notes, fold one pair of socks, tie running shoes...
  - a new habit shouldn't **feel** like a challenge
  - two minutes becomes a ritual of a larger routine
- one push-up is better than not exercising, one minute of reading is better than none -> it's better to do less than nothing
  - standardize before you optimize -> you can't improve a new habit that doesn't exist
- *master the habit of showing up*

### Chapter 14: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Habits Impossible
- success is sometimes more about making bad habits hard than making good habits easy
   - use a commitment device: a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future
    - ex: ask your waiter to split your meal before giving it to you instead of "I'll just eat half"
    - increase the odds that you'll do the right thing in the future by making bad habits difficult in the present
- onetime choices are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time
  - ex: buying a new mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan
- *take advantage of avenues that help you make bad habits difficult*

### Chapter 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change
- we are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience was satisfying
  - **but** the satisfaction needs to be immediate
  - you can't rely on good intentions because you will always prioritize the present moment
    - we all want a better future but when the moment of decision arrives, instant gratification wins
  - so add immediate pleasure to habits that pay off in the long run
    - ex: open a savings account for a jacket every time you say no to eating out
    - you make it satisfying to do nothing
    - but make sure the short term reward doesn't go against your habit
- a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last and change is easy when enjoyable
- *what is immediately rewarded is repeated, what is immediately punished is avoided*

### Chapter 16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day
- create visual measure of your progress
  - ex: moving a paperclip, crossing something off every day, etc.
- use a habit tracker
  - you won't want to break the chain
- no matter how consistent you are, you are bound to slip up -> but **never** miss twice
  - as soon as one streak ends, start another
  - the first mistake never ruins you but the spiral that follows does
  - missing twice is the start of a new habit
  - this separates winners and losers
- the bad workouts are more important than good ones because you at least maintain your gains
  - do something, not nothing
  - repeating something reaffirms your identity
- *never miss twice*

### Chapter 17: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything
- the more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior -> increase the speed of the punishment
  - add an instant cost to bad things so there is no gap between action and consequences
- use a habit contract to keep yourself accountable
  - an agreement of your commitment that is signed in a contract with others
  - ex: "I owe Timmy $50 if I miss a workout"
  - or do your habits with someone else
    - ex: "song a day" challenge with a friend
  - this works because we care about the opinions of those around us
- *having someone watch over you is powerful*

### Chapter 18: The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don't
- habits are easier to perform when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities
  - you want to play a game where the odds are in your favor
  - people are born with different abilities but the strength of genetics is also their weakness
    - genes are powerful in favorable circumstances but a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances
    - our environment determines our suitability of genes and the utility of our natural talents
    - so align your ambition with your ability
- build habits that work for your personality
  - choose the habit that best suits you, not the most popular one
  - how to decide what is most satisfying to you:
    1. What feels like fun to me, but work to others?
    2. What makes me lose track of time?
    3. Where do I get greater returns than the average person?
    4. What comes naturally to me?
- genes don't eliminate the need for hard work -> they tell us what to work hard on
  - spend your time and energy on your strengths
  - people get caught up in the fact that they have limits but rarely exert the effort required to get close to them
  - you don't know who has better genes if you haven't put in as much work as someone else
    - don't explain away their success as luck
- *work hard on things that come easy*

### Chapter 19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work
- the Goldilocks Rule: humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities
  - not too hard, not too easy -> just right
  - when starting a habit, make it as easy as possible so you stick with it
- once a habit has been established, you need to keep advancing it in small ways
  - keep yourself challenged at just manageable difficulty to maintain motivation and keep yourself from getting bored
- many people think that "it all comes down to passion"
  - this makes us depressed when we lost focus/motivation because we think that successful people are more passionate
    - this is **not true** -> everyone feels the same lack of motivation but successful people still find a way to show up when they get bored
- people prefer novelty and always want something new when they lose motivation
  - video games, junk food, etc. always keep things new
- when a habit is important to you, you need to be willing to stick with it no matter what
  - fall in love with boredom
- *the successful stick to a schedule, amateurs let life get in the way*

### Chapter 20: The Downside of Creating Good Habits
- habits + deliberate practice = mastery
  - you need a way to prevent complacency when you are working toward mastery -> reflection and review
- reflection and review makes you aware of your mistakes and consider ways to improve
  - this leads to long-term improvement
  - [annual review](https://jamesclear.com/annual-review) -> reflect on your progress
    1. What went well this year?
    2. What didn't go well this year?
    3. What did I learn?
  - [integrity report](https://jamesclear.com/integrity) -> figure on what went wrong and get back on track
    1. What are the core values that drive my life and work?
    2. How am I living and working with integrity right now?
    3. How can I set a higher standard in the future?
  - periodic reflection and review is like viewing yourself from a conversational distance
    - too much feedback isn't good
- avoid making an single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are
  - "keep your identity small"
  - when you cling too tightly to an identity, you become brittle -> lose that one thing and you lose yourself
    - When you spend your whole life by defining yourself by one thing that disappears, who are you now?
  - make your identity flexible
    - ex: I'm the CEO -> I'm a builder and a creator
- habits can lock you into previous ways of thinking and acting when the world is changing around you
  - so periodically check in to see if old habits and beliefs are still serving you
- *be self-aware*

### Conclusion: The Secret to Results that Last
- the holy grail of habit change is not a single 1% improvement, but 1000 of them
  - something may seem insignificant when you start, but gradually the scales of life start to move
  - make sure you have the right system for change
- behaviors are effortless when: obvious, attractive, easy, satisfying
- behaviors are difficult when: invisible, unattractive, hard, unsatisfying
- it's a continuous process -> there is no finish line or permanent solution
  - keep looking for a way to get 1% better
  - never stop making improvements
- the power of atomic habits -> tiny changes and remarkable results
- *never stop finding a way to get 1% better*

### Little Lessons from the Four Laws
- awareness comes before desire
  - a craving only occurs after you notice an opportunity
- happiness is simply the absence of desire
  - it occurs when you don't have an urge to feel differently
- it is the idea of pleasure that we chase
  - we don't know how something will actually make us feel
- peace occurs when you don't turn your observations into problems
  - you are just observing and existing but not wanting to change
- with a big enough why, you can overcome any how
  - you'll take action even when things are difficult
- being curious is better than being smart
  - it leads to action
- emotions drive behavior
  - you only feel compelled to act because of emotion
- we can only be rational and logical after we have been emotional
  - first we feel (system 1), then we think (system 2)
- your response tends to follow your emotions
  - people want what satisfies their desires
- suffering drives progress
  - wanting to change your state prompts action
- your actions reveal how badly you want something
  - if you say you want something, but don't act on it, you don't really want it
- reward is on the other side of sacrifice
  - reward after energy is spent
- self-control is difficult because it is not satisfying
  - it ignores your cravings
- our expectations determine our satisfaction
  - satisfaction = liking - wanting
- the pain of failure correlates to the height of expectation
  - when desire is high, it hurts not the like the outcome
- feelings come before and after the behavior
  - feel -> act and act -> feel
- desire initiates, pleasure sustains
  - you won't do it again if you don't like it
- hope declines with experience and is replaced by acceptance
  - something new has unbounded hope because we don't have any expectations -> in the beginning, hope is all you have
