# Poker Basics

### Lesson 1:

*   No limit means there is no limit to how much you can bet at a time
*   Cash game: come and go as you please (endless games)
*   Tournament: entry fee and everyone starts with the same number of chips

### Lesson 2: starting to play:

*   52 card deck with 2 - 10 players
*   Dealer position determines blinds buy may not actually deal (online)
*   Game
    *   Each player is dealt 2 cards face down (your hole cards)
    *   3 cards then dealt face up in the middle of the table (the flop - shared)
    *   4th card is the turn
    *   5th card is the river
    *   Make hand by combining your 2 with cards in the middle (best 5)
        *   You don’t have to use your hole cards though
*   Two players to the left of the dealer post blinds (small is the closer person)
    *   Blind = betting in the dark
        *   Big = 2 * small
    *   The button moves clockwise after each hand
*   4 betting rounds
    *   3 moves
        *   Fold
            *   No longer want to play
        *   Call
            *   Match the size of the current bet (at least big blind preflop)
        *   Raise (min is 2 * big blind)
            *   You want to increase bet
        *   Check 
            *   You don’t want to add anything in
    *   The betting round must finish before the next card is shown
    *   The betting round is complete when all fold or put in the same amount
    *   Preflop = round 1
        *   Betting solely based on hole cards
        *   Left of big blind goes first and then clockwise
    *   The flop = round 2
        *   Check, fold, call or raise
    *   The turn = round 3
    *   The river = round 4
    *   The showdown = any players who still have cards after round 4
        *   Each player makes the best 5 card hand (2 holes + community)
        *   Best hand wins the pot
        *   If two players have the same winning hand, the pot is split evenly
*   Hand rankings
    *   Ace = highest card in the deck
    *   Pair
    *   2 pair
    *   3 of a kind
    *   Straight (5 in a row of different suits)
        *   Ace can be high or low
    *   Flush (5 cards of the same suit - order does not matter)
    *   Full house (3 of a kind + a pair)
    *   Quad (four of a kind)
    *   Straight flush (five in a row - same suit)
    *   Royal flush (straight flush - 10 to ace) UNBEATABLE
    *   Note
        *   suits have no ranking
        *   High card differentiates same hands (ace is highest)
        *   Kicker = 2nd, 3rd, etc. highest card if the high card is the same

### Lesson 3: Position and Playing Style

*   The position is where you are relative to the dealer
    *   It is best to be the dealer (info = power)
    *   Dealer is the last person to act so has the most info about other players
        *   If everyone checks, they can be more aggressive
        *   If someone raises big, they can fold
*   Early position
    *   When you are closer to the blinds
    *   Probably only play really strong hands - probability is stacked against you
*   Late position
    *   Better odds even if your cards aren’t as good
    *   Really advantageous to bet later in future rounds when you can see what everyone else is doing
    *   If a lot of people fold early, you might as well play
*   General rule
    *   Play more hands from later positions 
*   Tight aggressive style
    *   Tight = play strong hands and fold weak
        *   Good to fold before the flop if you don’t have a strong hand
    *   Aggressive = bet and raise, rarely call
        *   Influence the game in your favor
        *   Bet consistently to maximize the pot
        *   You want your opponents to call
        *   You also want people to fold - this only happens when you raise
        *   Passive = small pot and increases opponent chances
            *   They will check or go to the showdown
    *   Basically, you wait for profitable situations and take advantage of them
*   Slow play
    *   When you check to keep your opponents in the hand
    *   This is a bad idea because your opponents can end up beating you with more cards showing from the community
    *   You also don’t want to give people the chance to win without investing anything
*   Position examples when you are the dealer (most info) with Ace and 5
    *   Everyone folds - you probably have a good hand -> raise
    *   Someone raises early and everyone fold - they have a better hand -> fold

### Lesson 4: Before the Flop

*   Poker starting hands
    *   Monsters: aces, kings, queens, and ace-king
        *   AA, KK, QQ, and sometimes AK (same suit)
        *   Always be played even from early and middle position or against a raise
        *   Be aggressive with these hands (raise)
    *   Very good: jacks, 10s, 9s, and ace + jack, etc.
        *   JJ, 1010, AK (off suit), AQ (same suit)
        *   Played and raise majority of the time
        *   Maybe fold if others re-raise
    *   Speculative
        *   Any pair 99 to 22
        *   Any ace with low kicker
        *   2 suited cards 10 or higher
        *   2 consecutive cards with same suit
        *   All these hands have potential, but aren’t very strong by themselves
            *   Fold if you have early position (someone could raise and pressure)
            *   In late, you can consider raising - especially if people before folded
                *   If people call, you can potentially be better
            *   FOLD if someone else shows greater strength or bad position
    *   Trash: everything else (7/2 off suit is the worst)
        *   FOLD
    *   Be patient and discipline
    *   Evaluating unpaired cards
        *   Look at rank: two high cards is much better than one
        *   Same suit: very good for making a flush
        *   Similar rank: closer hold cards = possible straight
        *   7 & 2 off suit is the worst: no straight or flush
*   Entering the pot
    *   3 options preflop: play (call or raise) or fold
    *   Three factors
        *   Hand strength
        *   Position
            *   If there are many people acting behind you, be selective with starting hands
        *   Opponent action
            *   Enter = they want to play
            *   Raise = they have a good hand
    *   First thing: evaluate strength of hold cards
        *   In the beginning, maybe only play strong and fold all others
        *   Once you play, be AGGRESSIVE

### Lesson 5: After the flop

*   Categories of hands
    *   Made hands
        *   Hand that has improved significantly
        *   Slight possibility to improve further 
        *   3 groups
            *   Monster hands
                *   Better than one pair on the flop
                *   AJAJ, 333
            *   Very good hands
                *   Top pair with top kicker
                *   QQ, AA
            *   Marginal hands
                *   Middle pair hands
                *   1010, JJ
    *   Drawing hands
        *   Hands that have connected with the flop but still need improvement to become a made hand
            *   J 10 -> Q 9 2 (almost a straight or flush)
        *   Very strong draws
            *   Combined straight and flush draws or draws + made hand
        *   Strong draws
            *   Open ended straight and flush draws (close to it and high)
        *   Weak draws
            *   Gutshot draws or flush or straight draws
    *   Trash
        *   You neither have a pair or a draw
        *   If you miss the flop, your hand is basically worthless
        *   Throw away and wait for something else
*   Reading the flop
    *   The flop can also help your opponents - important to learn how to categorize it
    *   Dry flops
        *   No possible draws
        *   A72, 33K, 1026
        *   Cards are spaced far away and low rank
        *   Impossible to pick up a flush draw or open-ended straight
            *   No connected cards—other players have a made hand or trash
    *   Draw heavy
        *   Contain a lot of draws
        *   1087, AQ10, 546
        *   Lots of potential for flush or open-ended straight
*   Post flop play
    *   If you flop a monster or very strong made hand
        *   Build a pot for you to win at showdown
        *   Protect your hand against draws
        *   Made hand already has potential to win at showdown
            *   Won’t improve much and can be beaten if someone draws
            *   So bet and raise heavily and force opponents to at least match bets
                *   You can make the pot unattractive for people going for draws to continue
                    *   They make a bad play or hold and try to win
            *   Your goal is to get to showdown with as much as possible
            *   BET AND RAISE
    *   Playing strong and marginal hands
        *   Can often win at showdown
        *   But don’t play huge pots - someone who will risk all their chips has a hand that is better than one pair
        *   Goal is to bet the right size
            *   Make people pay the price to try and hit draw
            *   Make people call with weaker hands
            *   Don’t risk your chips with mediocre made hands
            *   Use CAUTION

### Lesson 6: Betting

*   Four reasons to bet
    *   Build a pot and gain value for a strong hand (value bet)
    *   Protect a strong hand and make opponents pay to continue (protection bet)
    *   Force other people to fold so that your weak hand can win (bluff)
*   Value bet
    *   When you have a strong hand, ideal is to bet and get called (at least)
    *   Maximize return
*   Protection bet
    *   Out drawn = favoured hand beaten by weaker hand
        *   Protection bet safeguards from this
        *   Force your opponent to pay more to hit draw or fold
        *   Nuts = strongest hand in a given situation
*   Bluff
    *   Only bluff if you think it has a decent chance of making your opponent fold
    *   Make a bet with a weak hand to force others to throw away better hands
*   Bet sizing
    *   Size of a bet is measured relative to the **pot**
        *   Be aware of the pot so you know how much you can win
        *   Ex: if you bet 10 in a pot of 5, you risk a lot to gain a little
            *   Vs betting 100 in a pot of 1000
    *   Small bet = half the pot
        *   Usually made on a dry board (few connecting cards)
            *   Few to know possible draws available (no flush or straight)
            *   If you bluff small, you should bet small with a good hand
        *   river (all community cards are known)
            *   No one can outdraw you -> you don’t need to protect a big hand
        *   continuation (pre-flop raise)
            *   Continue your aggression
            *   Pick up the pot if your opponent missed the flop
    *   Medium bet = between half and three-quarters
        *   Decent pocket pair preflop
        *   Protect your hand on the flop
        *   A monster on the river
        *   A decent hand on the river
        *   A marginal hand on the river
    *   Large bet = more than three-quarters
        *   Put a lot of pressure on your opponents
        *   Useful to bluff people off decent hands, gain value with strong hands, or protect from strong draws
        *   Draw heavy board
            *   You have a good hand, but your opponents could get a straight or flush -> maybe double the pot
            *   Usually do this if you have a 2 pair (no pair on the board)
        *   Pre-flop
            *   Force out holdings that might beat you
        *   With the nuts
            *   Bet big to build a gigantic pot
            *   Or pretend and bluff
*   Outs
    *   Identifying cards that will improve your hand
    *   These are cards left in the deck that improve your hand to make it strong enough to win the pot at showdown
    *   Ex: you have A3 (H) and board is 7H 9S KH
        *   No one can have a full house if the board isn’t paired
        *   If you hit flush, you are in good shape (only straight/royal flush can win)
        *   You have 2 hearts and 2 on the board -> 4/13
            *   There are 9 hearts that could help you -> 9 outs
    *   Get used to calculating outs
    *   The rule of two and four
        *   This uses outs to help you decide if you should call, raise, or fold
        *   Once flop is dealt, count your outs
            *   Multiply that number by 2 to get the percentage of making your hard on the next card
            *   If there are two cards to come and there can be no betting on the turn (all in situation), multiply outs by 4 to get the percentage of making your hard when seeing both cards
            *   ** multiply by 4 if two cards are still to come, or two for only 1 card**
                *   This is your approximate chance
        *   In short: count your outs and multiply by two and four to get your chance of hitting your draw
            *   Use this for quick judgement
    *   Playing with conviction
        *   You can always: call, bet/raise, or fold or maybe check
            *   Most new players check/call or limp pre flop (match big blind instead of raising)
                *   This lets people enter the pot for cheap and draw
        *   Be CONFIDENT
            *   Either bet or raise if you think you have a better hand or fold and minimize your loss
            *   Calling = uncertainty 
                *   Have the courage of your convictions -> bet or fold
                *   Ex: you have top two pair (bet/raise) or you have pair on the flop (fold)
        *   Two ways to win the pot
            *   Have the best hand
            *   Force everyone else to fold
            *   If you only check and call -> you need a big hand at showdown
    *   ** choose good hands and play them HARD **
