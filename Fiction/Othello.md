# Themes from Othello by William Shakespeare

self-isolation as an act of self-preservation leads ultimately to self-destruction. Such self-isolation leads to the deaths of Roderigo, Iago, Othello, and even Emilia.

- Othello is isolated by his race
- Roderigo is attached to Iago
- Iago speaks in soliloquies and falls prey to his own obsession for revenge

Sight: Othello always believes things he doesn’t see, the action of the play depends heavily on characters *not* seeing things

- he strips Cassio of his position as lieutenant based on the story Iago tells
- he relies on Iago’s story of seeing Cassio wipe his beard with Desdemona’s handkerchief 
- he believes Cassio to be dead simply because he hears him scream.
- Othello accuses his wife although he never sees her infidelity, and Emilia, although she watches Othello erupt into a rage about the missing handkerchief, does not figuratively “see” what her husband has done

Handkerchief

- a symbol of Othello’s love. 
- Othello comes to see it as a symbol of Desdemona herself—her faith and chastity
- woven by a 200-year-old sibyl, or female prophet, using silk from sacred worms and dye extracted from the hearts of mummified virgins
- Othello claims that his mother used it to keep his father faithful to her, so, to him, the handkerchief represents marital fidelity.

Jealousy

- how jealousy can be fueled by mere circumstantial evidence and can destroy lives. 
- In *Othello*, the hero succumbs to jealousy when Iago convinces him that Desdemona has been an unfaithful wife – in the end, Othello murders his wife and then kills himself
- It is interesting that Iago uses jealousy against Othello, yet jealousy is likely the source of Iago's hatred in the first place
- jealousy takes many forms, from sexual suspicion to professional competition, but it is, in all cases, destructive

Identity: Shakespeare explores factors that play an important role in the formations of one's identity – race, gender, social status, family relationships, military service, etc. *Othello* is also concerned with how an individual's sense of identity (which can break down and be manipulated by others) shapes his or her actions.

- Othello's rage at Desdemona's infidelity has nothing to do with his love for her; rather, for him, it signals the destruction of his own identity as a successful and loved man.
- In *Othello*, a man's reputation seems to hinge on military duty and public behavior, while a woman's identity often hinges on her sexual reputation.

Marriage

- In *Othello*, marriage is tantamount to death.
- *Othello* suggests that, as long as men view women as being promiscuous and disloyal, the institution of marriage is doomed.

Jealousy and Masculinity

- The reason Iago chooses to hurt Othello by making him jealous is that Iago is consumed by jealousy himself.
- In *Othello,* Shakespeare proves that jealousy is inherently unreasonable, as it is founded on the psychological issues of the jealous person, not on the behavior of the one who prompts the jealous feelings.

Race

- In *Othello*, Shakespeare creates a hero who is not a racist stereotype. Despite this, Shakespeare ultimately allows Othello to succumb to the subtle racism that surrounds him.
- Othello views his own racial identity as undesirable, and it is this lack of confidence in himself that allows Iago to persuade him that Desdemona is cheating on him.

Othello’s Suicide

- He loved Desdemona too much and doesn’t understand what he’s truly done
- Preoccupied with the way people will remember him
- Compares himself to the bad turk who he killed; he has succumbed to the racism around him and views himself as one
