### Quotes I like:
- "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."
- "Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs."
- "Every goal is doomed to fail if it goes against the grain of human nature."
- "Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior."
- "Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one."
- "We don't choose our earliest habits, we imitate them."
- "A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper, underlying motive."

### Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Haibts
- improving by 1% isn't notable (or noticable), but it is meaningful in the long run
  - 1% better each day = 37% better after one year but 1% worse every day = almost 0 after a year
  - habits can compound for or against you -> double edged sword
- forget about goals and focus on systems
  - goals = results -> good for setting direction
    - winners and losers have the same goals
    - achieving a goal is only a momentary change
  - systems = processes that lead to results -> good for **making progress**
    - spend more time designing systems of continuous small improvements
- atomic = a tiny change and (like atoms as building blocks) and habits are like the atoms of our life
- *try to get 1% better each day*

### Chapter 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity
- there are three layers of behavior change
  1. changing your outcomes -> **what you get**
    - ex: losing weight, winning a competition, etc.
  2. changing your process -> **what you do**
    - new routine at the gym, becoming more organized, etc.
  3. changing your identity (deepest) -> **what you believe**
    - changing your beliefs, worldview, self-image, judgements
- build identity based habits by focusing on *who* you wish to become 
  - NOT what you want to achieve
  - ex: I want to quit smoking vs I am not a smoker
  - the more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior
- the real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results but because they can change your beliefs about yourself
- *habits are beliefs*

### Chapter 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
- a habit is a behavior repeated enough times to become automatic
- 4 parts to a habit: cue, craving, response, reward
  - cue triggers the craving, which motivates a response, which satisfies the craving, and ultimately becomes associated with the cue
      - form a neurological feedback loop -> habit loop
      - ex: you wake up, you want to feel alert, you drink coffee, you satisfy your craving to feel alert -> drinking coffee becomes associated with waking up
- the 4 laws of behavior change
  - if you want to make a behavior change, ask yourself the following 4 questions:
    1. How can I make it obvious/invisible?
    2. How can I make it attractive/unattractive?
    3. How can I make it easy/difficult?
    4. How can I make it satisfying/unsatisfying?
- *habits are a cycleâ€”use the cycle to your advantage*

### Chapter 4: The Man Who Didn't Look Right
- you don't need to be aware of a cue for a habit to begin
  - your actions become automatic as habits form
  - the first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them
- *make sure you are aware of your habits*

### Chapter 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit
- implementation intention: a plan you make beforehand about **when** and **where** to act
  - how you plan to implement a habit
  - format: when situation X rises, I will perform response Y
  - people who make a specific plan for when & where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through
    - I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]
- the Diderot Effect: obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases
  - ex: you buy a dress and then matching shoes, earrings... a chain reaction of purchases
  - habit stacking: identify a habit you already do every day and then stack your new behavior on top
  - after I \[CURRENT HABIT], I will \[NEW HABIT]
    - ex: after I pour my cup of coffee, I will meditate
    - you can create larger stacks by chaining smaller habits
- *have a plan*

### Chapter 6: Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More
- you don't have to be a victim of your environment, you can be an architect of it
  - make the cue a big part of your environment
  - make the **best** choice the most **obvious** one -> easy when cues for good habits are in front of you
- a stable environment where everything has a place and purpose is an environment where habits can easily form
  - it is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting old cues
- *if you see it, you'll do it -> make yourself see it*

### Chapter 7: The Secret to Self-Control
- people with self-control are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control
  - they are usually the ones that use it least -> it's easier to practice restraint when you don't have to use it often
  - create a more disciplined environment
- once a habit becomes encoded, the urge to act follows whenever a cue reappears -> behavior change techniques can backfire
  - ex: shaming people to lose weight can make them feel stress so they overeat to cope
  - habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself
    - ex: you feel bad so you eat junk food and when you eat junk food, you feel bad -> it's a downward spiral...
- you can break a habit, but you are unlikely to forget it
  - so cut bad habits off at the source
    - reduce exposure to the cues that cause them
    - ex: move the TV out of your bedroom, stop following social media accounts that make you feel jealous, etc. 
    - instead of making it obvious, make it invisible
- *it's easier to avoid temptation than resist it"

### Chapter 8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible
- habit stacking + temptation building
  - formula: 
    1. after I \[CURRENT HABIT], I will \[HABIT I NEED]
    2. after I \[HABIT I NEED], I will \[HABIT I WANT]
- temptation building is a way to create a heightened version of any habit by connecting it with something you already want
- habits are dopamine driven: when dopamine rises, we are more likely to act
  - the anticipation of a reward, not the fulfillment of it, gets us to act
- *make your habits attractive*

### Chapter 9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits
- humans are herd animals -> we want to fit in
  - social norms are the invisible rules that guide human behavior
  - we imitate three groups
    1. the close
      - proximity has a powerful effect on behavior
      - physical & social environment
    2. the many
      - we look to the group to guide our behavior
      - the tribe overpowers the individual
    3. the powerful
      - we want power, prestige, and status
      - greater power = more resources...
- *surround yourself with the people you want to become*

### Chapter 10: How to Find and Fix the Cauess of Your Bad Habits
- every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper, underlying motive
  - I want to eat tacos (craving) -> I need food to survive -> I have to eat to survive (motive)
  - habits are modern day solutions to ancient desires
  - life feels reactive but it is actually predictive
- reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast way to reprogram your mind to think habits are more attractive
  - give yourself motivation by doing something you enjoy right before a difficult habit
- *link habits with your feelings*
