# Atomic Habits

### Memorable Quotes:
- "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."

### Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Haibts
- improving by 1% isn't notable (or noticable), but it is meaningful in the long run
  - 1% better each day = 37% better after one year but 1% worse every day = almost 0 after a year
  - habits can compound for or against you -> double edged sword
- forget about goals and focus on systems
  - goals = results -> good for setting direction
    - winners and losers have the same goals
    - achieving a goal is only a momentary change
  - systems = processes that lead to results -> good for **making progress**
    - spend more time designing systems of continuous small improvements
- atomic = a tiny change and (like atoms as building blocks) and habits are like the atoms of our life
