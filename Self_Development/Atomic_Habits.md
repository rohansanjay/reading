# Atomic Habits

### Memorable Quotes:
- "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."
- "Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs."
- "Every goal is doomed to fail if it goes against the grain of human nature."

### Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Haibts
- improving by 1% isn't notable (or noticable), but it is meaningful in the long run
  - 1% better each day = 37% better after one year but 1% worse every day = almost 0 after a year
  - habits can compound for or against you -> double edged sword
- forget about goals and focus on systems
  - goals = results -> good for setting direction
    - winners and losers have the same goals
    - achieving a goal is only a momentary change
  - systems = processes that lead to results -> good for **making progress**
    - spend more time designing systems of continuous small improvements
- atomic = a tiny change and (like atoms as building blocks) and habits are like the atoms of our life

### Chapter 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity
- there are three layers of behavior change
  1. changing your outcomes -> **what you get**
    - ex: losing weight, winning a competition, etc.
  2. changing your process -> **what you do**
    - new routine at the gym, becoming more organized, etc.
  3. changing your identity (deepest) -> **what you believe**
    - changing your beliefs, worldview, self-image, judgements
- build identity based habits by focusing on *who* you wish to become 
  - NOT what you want to achieve
  - ex: I want to quit smoking vs I am not a smoker
  - the more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior
- the real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results but because they can change your beliefs about yourself

### Chapter 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
- a habit is a behavior repeated enough times to become automatic
- 4 parts to a habit: cue, craving, response, reward
  - cue triggers the craving, which motivates a response, which satisfies the craving, and ultimately becomes associated with the cue
      - form a neurological feedback loop -> habit loop
      - ex: you wake up, you want to feel alert, you drink coffee, you satisfy your craving to feel alert -> drinking coffee becomes associated with waking up
- the 4 laws of behavior change
  - if you want to make a behavior change, ask yourself the following 4 questions:
    1. How can I make it obvious/invisible?
    2. How can I make it attractive/unattractive?
    3. How can I make it easy/difficult?
    4. How can I make it satisfying/unsatisfying?
