### 1.1 Fast Addition and Subtraction

- Add two digits at a time, write the answer for that, and maintain the carries
  - Ex: 1357 + 2633
    - 57 + 33 = 90
    - 12 + 26 = 39
    - Final answer: 3990
  - Ex: 2035 - 328
    - 35 - 28 = 7
    - 20 - 3 = 17
    - Final answer: 1707
- Note: subtract before you add because it's easier to deal with smaller numbers

### 1.2 PEMDAS Approximations

- Do operations for the highest 2 place values and round the rest because you estimate within 5%
  - Ex: 71239 + 47458 - 22334 
    - 71 + 47 - 22 = 71 + 25 = 96 -> 96000
